> Next.js Notion Starter Kit

> The perfect starter kit for building websites with Next.js and Notion.


## Intro

This Open Source project has been inspired from portfolio site of [transitivebullsh.it](https://transitivebullsh.it)

It uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) to render everything.



## Features

- Setup only takes a few minutes ([single config file](./site.config.js)) 
- Robust support for Notion content via [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x)
- Next.js / TS / React / Notion
- Automatic pretty URLs
- Automatic table of contents
- Full support for dark mode
- Responsive for desktop / tablet / mobile
- Optimized for Next.js

## Setup

**All config is defined in [site.config.js](./site.config.js).**

1. Fork / clone this repo
2. Change root notion id and few values in [site.config.js](./site.config.js)
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` to test locally
5. `npm run deploy` to deploy to vercel 

I tried to make configuration as easy as possible.

All you really need to do to get started is edit `rootNotionPageId`.

You'll want to make your root Notion page **public** and then copy the link to your clipboard. Then extract the last part of the URL that looks like `d1b5dcf8b9ff425b8aef5ce6f0730202`, which is your page's Notion iD.


## URL Paths

The app defaults to slightly different pathnames in dev and prod (though pasting any dev pathname into prod will work and vice-versa).

In development, it will use `/nextjs-notion-blog-d1b5dcf8b9ff425b8aef5ce6f0730202` which is a slugified version of the page's title suffixed with its Notion ID. I've found that it's really useful to always have the Notion Page ID front and center during local development.

In production, it will use `/nextjs-notion-blog` which is a bit nicer as it gets rid of the extra ID clutter.

The mapping of Notion ID to slugified page titles is done automatically for you as part of the build process. Just keep in mind that if you plan on changing page titles over time, you probably want to make sure old links will still work, and we don't currently provide a solution for detecting old links aside from Next.js built-in [support for redirects](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects).

See [mapPageUrl](./lib/map-page-url.ts) and [getCanonicalPageId](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/blob/master/packages/notion-utils/src/get-canonical-page-id.ts) from for more details.

NOTE: if you have multiple pages in your workspace with the same slugified name, the app will throw an error letting you know that there are duplicate URL pathnames.

## Theming

All CSS styles that customize Notion content are located in [styles/notion.css](./styles/notion.css).

They mainly target global CSS classes exported by react-notion-x [styles.css](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/blob/master/packages/react-notion-x/src/styles.css).

It should be pretty easy to customize most styling-related things, especially with local development and hot reload.
